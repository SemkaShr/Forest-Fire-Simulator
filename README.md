Forest fire - uncontrolled burning of vegetation and spontaneous spread of fire in the forest area.

The factor of fire occurrence in the forest is usually divided into natural and anthropogenic. The main cause of forest fires is human activity, today the proportion of large fires (from lightning) is about 7-8%. Thus, there is an acute scheduled work of fire services, control over the connection of fire safety equipment. The size of the fires makes it possible to observe them effectively even from space.

the most common due to serious causes of forest fires on Earth are outbreaks, a significant reduction in forest fires caused by the consequences of volcanoes, meteorites.

In young forests, in which there is a lot of greenery, the probability of ignition from probability is much lower than in mature forests, where there are many suspicious and diseased trees. Thus, in nature, even before man, there is a peculiar natural balance. The ecological role of forest fires was the natural renewal of forests.

On Earth, more than 340 million hectares of natural areas (including forests) are annually damaged by fire. The largest areas of annually burning forests are in Australia and African countries. In terms of the total area of â€‹â€‹forests destroyed by fires, Russia ranks 8th among the countries of the world. According to the official space monitoring data of the Federal Forestry Agency (ISDM-Rosleskhoz), in 2018, 15,402,746 hectares of land of various categories burned down on the territory of the Russian Federation (including 9,991,968 hectares of forest), in 2019 16,510,417 hectares of land burned (in including 10,029,569 ha of forest)

Existing methods for assessing the forest fire situation make it possible to determine the area and perimeter of the zone of possible fires in the region (region, district). The initial data are the value of the forest fire coefficient and the time of fire development.

The value of the forest fire coefficient depends on natural conditions and the year.

The time of development of a fire is the time from the moment of its occurrence until the arrival of forces and means to extinguish the fire.

#### Fire fighting methods:
Fire-fighting and preventive work aimed at preventing the occurrence, spread and development of forest fires helps to reduce forest losses due to fires.

Works to prevent the spread of forest fires include a number of silvicultural measures (sanitary felling, cleaning of logging sites, etc.), as well as measures to create a system of fire barriers in the forest and the construction of various fire-fighting facilities.

The forest becomes non-combustible if it is cleared of dead wood and fallen trees, the undergrowth is removed, 2-3 mineralized strips are laid with a distance of 50-60 m between them, and the ground cover between them is periodically burned out.

In order to somehow prevent forest fires and understand the algorithm of their work, we created this program that simulates a forest fire and shows us a simulation of the destruction and restoration of the forest. Perhaps this project will help save more forests in the future, as people can know how fire spreads and how to deal with it.
